# Bridge Editor

This is an *unofficial* editor for Pirate MIDI devices.

It does not cover all Bridge4/6 functionality but serves my personal needs and serves as a real world testing environment for `pirate-midi-usb` and a learning environment for Solid JS.

Please feel free to use the app and create GitHub issues with any issues you encounter but keep in mind this is a personal (free time, unpaid) project for my own needs.

As such, all use is at your own risk.

## Development

```bash
$ npm install # or pnpm install or yarn install
```

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm dev` or `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `dist` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles Solid in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

## Deployment

Bridge editor is deployed to Vercel for hosting.
